# .files
~My configs + some utilities.~ I don't use these dotfiles anymore. I might upload my current configuration if I have time to clear out work-stuffs.
## Utilities
### brew-autoremove
A manual autoremove for brew.
### emacs systemd user-service
Something like this might already be packaged with emacs these days?
```
systemctl --user enable EmacsServer
systemctl --user start EmacsServer
```
